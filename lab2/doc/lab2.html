<p><i>
In this lab you will be introduced to histograms for object
representation. The <em>Mean-Shift</em> tracking algorithm uses a
histogram for object representation, so this is one of the parts of the
final implementation.</i>
</p>

<h2>More information on last week's assignment</h2>
<p>A few remarks on last week's assignment. After reading an image from disk
with <code>imread</code>, the data is of type <code>uint8</code>. This
means that are values of the image are stored as integer-type, and <em>not</em>
as floating point values. Before doing anything with this image, it is
necessary to convert the image to type <code>double</code>. The easiest way
to do this, is by using the command <code>im2double</code>, which scales the
values between 0 and 1. Note that omitting this step will <em>not</em> cause
an error in the subsequent calculations, but the values will simply be
rounded off to the nearest integer value. In the case of converting to
normalized-<em>rgb</em>, this means that all values will become either
0 or 1!</p>

<p>Most of you implemented the function to convert <em>RGB</em> to <em>rgb</em>
correctly, but did not take into account black pixels. In the case of a black
pixel, the intensity of the pixel (i.e. R + G + B) is 0. Hence, computing
r = R/(R+G+B) is not defined, and consequently the conversion is quite noisy
for pixels with a low intensity (i.e. near-black pixels). The best way to
deal with this, is to identify the pixels with a low intensity (or at least the
complete black pixels), and deal with these pixels separately. You can do this
by using logical arrays. Take, as an example, the following simple computation:<br>
</p><pre>A = [-3 3 -2 2 -1 1];
B = A .* 2;
</pre>
Now, if we would only want to multiply the positive values with two, and leave the
negative values as they are, then we could create and use a logical array in the
following way:<br>
<pre>mask = A &gt; 0;
B(mask) = A(mask).*2;
B(~mask) = A(~mask);
</pre>
You can apply this on the conversion of <em>RGB</em> to <em>rgb</em> by extending
this to 2 or more dimensions.
<p>
For the opponent color space, read the section on the opponent color
theory in Theo's color survey. For the formula, have a look at the
first publication in my publication list.
</p>

<h2>Details on this week's assignment</h2>
<p>
This weeks task is to experiment with histogram creation and histogram
back projection. You can use the <a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/%7Eksande/teaching/ims/data">images of Nemo</a> (or
any other image, for that matter) as test images. For instance, as a
first step, try to create a representation of Nemo, and see if histogram
back projection can find the location of Nemo in this image.
</p>
<p>
Histograms are frequently used for image and
object representation, as you might know. A histogram contains information
about the colours present in an object. Histograms are of course not limited
to colour, other aspects of objects can also be used in the histogram. For
this lab we will assume colour histograms, but you are free to experiment
with other features for your final application.
</p>
<p>
A histogram can be seen as a (quantised) representation of the colours
in an image, without any of the spatial information. But histograms are
also a way to represent statistical distributions, representing the
distribution of colours in a certain object. Seen in this light, the
values in the histogram bins represent the likelihood that a colour
occurs in the represented object.
</p>
<p>
This histogram data can be used to detect a known object through
<em>histogram back projection</em>. If we assume that our histogram of
the object contains a representative distribution for the target object,
we can use this to detect that object. Since the bins in the histogram
indicate the likelihood that a pixel of that colour is part of the
target object, we assign all pixels in the candidate image the value
from their corresponding histogram bins. Pixels that have a colour that
is dominant in the target object will have a high value and are as such
visible in the likelihood image.
</p>
<p>
To restrict the histogram to an object instead of a
whole image, you could perform several tricks. You could crop the image
and create an image containing only the object. Or you could use the
masking that you also used in the previous lab. This mask could be
filled parametrically (using some sort of function are inequality, e.g.
<code>x &lt; 10 || x &gt; 213</code>). Another option is to open the image in
an editing program, e.g. Paint, and paint the object white and the rest
of the image black, and create a mask from this image.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the result of this procedure can be improved by weighting the
histogram with a histogram of background objects (i.e. everything but
the target). This histogram is simply the ratio of the target histogram
divided by the non-target histogram. The result of this procedure is
that colour values, which are also prominent in the background, will
have a lower value. Some experimenting is needed to see if this
theoretical improvement also leads to real-life improvements.
</p>

<p>
So, to summarize, for this week's assignment, you should:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>Implement a function to create a 2D- or 3D-histogram of your image,
depending on the color space you are using. For instance, RGB requires a
3D-histogram, normalized-RGB, i.e. <em>rgb</em>, only needs a 2D-histogram
(why?). Try visualizing your histogram to verify that it is correct.</li>
<li>In the opponent color space, negative values can occur. Why?</li>
<li>Use histogram back projection to find an learned object (e.g. Nemo) back
in an image containing this object (a visual inspection to see if you can recognize
the location of Nemo is sufficient).
Try several of the color spaces that you
implemented, and analyze the results on different images. In what color spaces
can find the object back? Are there any conditions that might cause the failure
of finding the object back, or do certain color spaces perform better than others?</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that's it for now. Have fun!</p>
